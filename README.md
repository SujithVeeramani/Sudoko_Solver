# Sudoku Solver with Graph Algorithms

This Python program generates a Sudoku board, visualizes it using NetworkX, and provides two solving algorithms: a backtracking approach and a heuristic algorithm. The solved Sudoku is displayed graphically, allowing users to explore different solutions interactively.
